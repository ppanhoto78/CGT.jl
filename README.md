This program computes the Capital Gain Tax (in Ireland) for stock sold through ETrade.  
First, download the excel sheet with the trades for the year from Etrade -> Stock Plan -> My Account
-> Gains & Losses -> Download -> Download Expanded.  
Install [Julia](https://julialang.org/downloads/).  
Run the program with `julia main.jl <path_to_excel_file>` (try `julia main.jl --help` to see all the
options).
